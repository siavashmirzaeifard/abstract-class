# abstract classes

This project contains some examples about abstract classes with definitions.


## Definition

Abstract classes in Dart are the classes which can not be initialize. It means that you can not call it's constructor directly to create a variable. However abstract classes can actually have constructors.

Abstract classes are just like our skeleton classes either contain abstract methods and getter for instance of variables that they put constrain on subclasses to implement, and/or they can have functions with default implementation. They can act like Protocols in Swift or Interface# in Java and allow you to have some default implementation for the variables or for the functions.
